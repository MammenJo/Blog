                This is the best place for barbeque in bangalore, no doubt about it. For non-veggies this is the perfect place for barbeque startups which will fill up your tummy so much that you dont even need to try the mains !!! For veggies options are limited. I am saying this that mains are not so attractive compared to non veg startups. Ensure you book a table in advance. Perfect for big groups of people. One of the best thing I liked about the place is the mind blowing service, the staff won't let you down in anyway. The cleanliness they maintain during these difficult COVID - 19 situation is commendable.

                An amazing and serene place to walk around in, and drop all your worries out one of the four well-places gates of a majestic flora.
                The Lalbagh has always been Bangalore‚Äôs flagship attractions and it surely is worth the hype. You may run along the well-laid circuit, or rest amidst the cool shrubbery and trees, or laze overlooking the lotus pond too! So, don‚Äôt miss out a chance to visit the garden on the weekends.

                I loved the movie a lot
                As I am great fan of marvel
                Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humour, emotions and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climatic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humour doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.

            You‚Äôve all probably seen the internet sensation that is ‚ÄúFluffy Cows.‚Äù Now, before you roll your eyes and move on, dismissing this as not ‚Äúreal world‚Äù or as something that came from the show ring that doesn‚Äôt apply to production, let me give you the low down on #fluffycows and the show world.Many of you are familiar, but the #fluffycows sensation that took the World Wide Web by storm put beef in the headlines. People wanted to know what those cattle were, how they got that way, and what became of them. It allowed for open discussion about the cattle industry and the educational factor associated with youth shows. Many cattleman scoffed at #fluffycows and dismissed them as ‚Äúnot functional‚Äù or ‚Äúnot real world‚Äù and, in some cases, they‚Äôre not wrong.As a kid who grew up in the show ring, I can remember often hearing a judge say, ‚ÄúWe would love to have a pen of these cattle on feed, but today this steer isn‚Äôt [insert trendy phrase here] enough to win my class.‚Äù (Please know that this is generalized for our purposes here today.)As an industry member, my dad, who usually produced our steers, took this as a compliment; but as a super competitive youth, this was a hard lesson for me. The cattle I saw in the show ring and on our family ranch were my window into the industry at that time. We won some shows with our ‚Äúreal world‚Äù cattle, and I have to say were always complimented on them, whether on the microphone or with ribbons and buckles.
